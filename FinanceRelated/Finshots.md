## The RBI's Assessment-Key Highlights from the Monetary Policy Meet
**August 7, 2020**   
**high frequency indicators:**  
data that is available frequently. Tell us indights before the official growth numbers. Bottom line — They can tell us so much about what’s happening in the economy even when the statisticians haven’t put out the growth numbers yet (which is only done once every quarter). And while high-frequency indicators have collapsed in the recent past, RBI thinks they finally seem to be levelling off. Maybe this is a turning point.
**Inflation:**    
RBI has a mandate, centred around stability. The RBI also thinks we might have to worry about cost-push inflation. Usually, prices increase when producers have to worry about higher production costs. This might happen when people have to borrow at ridiculously high-interest rates to keep the operations going. But interest rates have been pretty modest for a while now and it seems production costs are trending upwards simply because labour is hard to come by. People are going home. They are switching jobs. It’s a mess. Maybe, it will take a while before costs can normalize. But until then, the RBI doesn’t want to do anything that might push prices even further. They will wait. They will watch and they will act once prices moderate. Which, by the way, they think will happen soon enough considering we are expecting a really good monsoon this year.  
**On restructuring:**  
RBI looks out for banks where defaulters don't repay ther loans and wants to restructure the loans. ALso, some can get some leeway. MSMEs' also get leeway. Gold loans are highly dependant on collatoral.  
**Loan-to-Value ratio**. But if the value of collatoral decreases, the risk for the bank increases.  

## What is happening to Boeng and Airbus?
**August 10, 2020**
Passengers have decreased by 91%. Boing and Airbus not recieving orders contradictory to their earlier plans. So they cut jobs, upto 35000+, Rolls royce have to also bear the burden of cost cutting. ALso, new airplanes are ordered ahead of delivary, so, someone might order an aircraft while profiting and getting delivary while in crisis. 
- As Bloomberg puts it.

> This risks creating a dynamic that pits the plane makers against ailing carriers, as they try to get them to honor contracts and accept jets they can’t afford and don’t need. If they don’t press carriers to pay for at least some of the planes ordered during flush times, then the airframe manufacturers will have to burn more cash to keep their operations humming. But if they push too hard, they could further hobble some customers financially — endangering future sales or even driving them toward bankruptcy, jeopardizing existing contracts.
-  Boing had a 787 order from middle east, they suddenly wanted another discoint over already given 55%, so, by not honoring the contract, customer would have to pay $100 million but giving the plan at the reduced cost would have costed boing more, so they gave another 15% discount. 
During April and June, Boing burned theough $5.6 billion cash,  Airbus lost $5.2 billion.

## The AGR Saga continues:
**August 11**
The Supreme Court on Monday observed the government to prepare a plan to recover adjusted gross revenue (AGR)-related dues from bankrupt telecom operators including Reliance Communications Ltd, Aircel Group and Videocon Communications Ltd.   
As we already noted, the Supreme Court is yet to decide on a timeline. We know they don’t want to wait for 20 years. But telecom companies can’t make the payment within a few months either. However, a few telecom operators currently dealing with bankruptcy proceedings might be able to clear their dues if they were allowed to sell their assets without a hitch.  
But there is a point of contention — Spectrum.  
The most valuable asset in a telco’s balance sheet is the spectrum allocated to the company. Think of spectrum allocation as the government’s way of auctioning radio frequencies (4G airwaves for example). Who gets to use how much, depends on the spectrum you own. Unfortunately, the exact definition of ownership is slightly dubious when it comes to state resources.
### When Volcanoes erupt:
Yesterday, Mount Sinabung (located in Indonesia) erupted producing an eruption column of volcanic materials as high as 5,000 meters into the sky. Airline industty lost $2bn. Areable land was deposited with ash. Cost $10bn. Also, relocation charges of 30000 people. 

## Why India can't monetize it's Gold:
**August 12**
India's obsession of Gold dosen't always bode well for us.
> You can’t buy gold from foreign countries using rupees. You have to pay for it with the dollar. So when there’s a disproportionate demand for gold, there is a disproportionate demand for the dollar. Everybody rushes to exchange their rupees dumping it like an ex they never wanted to talk to and start courting the dollar. The value of the dollar rises and the value of rupee tumbles. And as the rupee loses its value it becomes more expensive for us to import other stuff, like oil. Unlike Gold, we actually need oil. So, it makes sense for us to cut down on gold imports.
