## The RBI's Assessment-Key Highlights from the Monetary Policy Meet
**August 7, 2020**   
**high frequency indicators:**  
data that is available frequently. Tell us indights before the official growth numbers. Bottom line — They can tell us so much about what’s happening in the economy even when the statisticians haven’t put out the growth numbers yet (which is only done once every quarter). And while high-frequency indicators have collapsed in the recent past, RBI thinks they finally seem to be levelling off. Maybe this is a turning point.
**Inflation:**    
RBI has a mandate, centred around stability. The RBI also thinks we might have to worry about cost-push inflation. Usually, prices increase when producers have to worry about higher production costs. This might happen when people have to borrow at ridiculously high-interest rates to keep the operations going. But interest rates have been pretty modest for a while now and it seems production costs are trending upwards simply because labour is hard to come by. People are going home. They are switching jobs. It’s a mess. Maybe, it will take a while before costs can normalize. But until then, the RBI doesn’t want to do anything that might push prices even further. They will wait. They will watch and they will act once prices moderate. Which, by the way, they think will happen soon enough considering we are expecting a really good monsoon this year.
**On restructuring:**  
RBI looks out for banks where defaulters don't repay ther loans and wants to restructure the loans. ALso, some can get some leeway. MSMEs' also get leeway. Gold loans are highly dependant on collatoral.
**Loan-to-Value ratio**. But if the value of collatoral decreases, the risk for the bank increases.
